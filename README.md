# Images 

We can add an image to our html page ba adding this tag: 

`<img src ="" alt="" >`

`src` is mandadory attribute for this tag and it spesifies the URL of the image that we want to add to our page. 
This image can be either 'absolute' or 'relative'. 

ofcourse it is better we save our images in a folder in our website and use them in our page by using 'relative addess'. 

`alt` is another attribute for images that it is not necessary but it is highly recommended that we use it. 

the value we produce for `alt` attribute is by our choice but it is important because it used when our image does not download because of any reason. so the browser will show the text we put as the value of `alt` attribute as an alternative for image. 

it used by search engines also to find out that what about is this image we placed in our website. so it helps to clients to find our website.
