 <p>
    Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company that specializes in consumer electronics,
     software and online services headquartered in Cupertino, California, United States. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue 
     (totaling US$365.8 billion in 2021) and as 
     of June 2022, it is the world's biggest company by market capitalization, the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by 
     unit sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five American
      information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.


    Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs,
     Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer.
      It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer
      , the Apple II, became a best seller. Apple went public in 1980, to instant financial success. The company developed computers
       featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the original Macintosh, announced in a critically acclaimed advertisement,
        "1984", directed by Ridley Scott. By 1985, the high cost of its products and power struggles between
         executives caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while
          Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.
    
    As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost
     considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered 
     PC clones (also known as "Wintel"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple
     's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided
      Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad
       to critical acclaim, launching "Think different" and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store
        retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio.
         When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.
    
    Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018,
     then $2 trillion in August 2020, and most recently $3 trillion in January 2022. The company receives criticism regarding
      the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices
       and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty.
        It is ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.

    The Samsung Group[3] (or simply Samsung, stylized as SΛMSUNG) (Korean: 삼성 [samsʌŋ]) is
     a South Korean multinational manufacturing conglomerate headquartered in Samsung Town,
      Seoul, South Korea.[1] It comprises numerous affiliated businesses,[1] most of them united under
       the Samsung brand, and is the largest South Korean chaebol (business conglomerate). As of 2020, Samsung
        has the 8th highest global brand value.[4]

Samsung was founded by Lee Byung-chul in 1938 as a trading company. Over the next three decades, the group diversified
 into areas including food processing, textiles, insurance, securities, and retail. Samsung entered the electronics industry
  in the late 1960s and the construction and shipbuilding industries in the mid-1970s; these areas would drive its
   subsequent growth. Following Lee's death in 1987, Samsung was separated into five business groups – Samsung Group,
    Shinsegae Group, CJ Group and Hansol Group, and Joongang Group.
